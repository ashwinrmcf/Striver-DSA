i)Problem Statement
  Given an integer array of length n, print the largest element present in the array.

ii)Approach (Algorithm / Strategy) - Brute-force comparison

  Initialize a variable max (set to 0 in the current code).

  Use two nested loops: for every element arr[i], compare it with every other element arr[j].

  Whenever arr[i] is greater than arr[j] and greater than max, update max = arr[i].

  After all comparisons, print max.

iii)Time Complexity

  The two nested loops each run n times → O(n²) comparisons.

iv)Space Complexity

  Only constant extra variables (max, loop counters) are used → O(1) auxiliary space.
